## What's already closed

### MUSTs (RFC 1122 §3.2.2 host requirements — ICMP)

All MUSTs across both v4 and v6 inbound paths are met:

- §3.2.2 unknown-type silent discard ✅
- §3.2.2 ICMP-error generation gates (5 MUST NOTs) ✅ (α0 → α1.1)
- §3.2.2 embedded-datagram unchanged ✅
- §3.2.2.1 Destination Unreachable → transport (v4 + v6) ✅
- §3.2.2.4 Time Exceeded → transport (v4 + v6) ✅ (β.1 → β.4)
- §3.2.2.5 Parameter Problem → transport (v4 + v6) ✅ (β.3 → β.5)
- §3.2.2.6 Echo server (with Smurf gate) ✅ (A1)

### Security-critical

- A1 Smurf gate on Echo handler ✅
- A2 rate limit on outbound ICMP errors ✅
- A4 bcast/mcast/src-invalid/non-initial-frag gates ✅

### SHOULDs

- #1 — Protocol Unreachable / Param Problem code 1 generation on
  unsupported proto / next-header ✅ (`6f44091e`)
- #2 — Parameter Problem outbound generation on inbound IP-header
  sanity errors ✅ (commits `dd68e3ac` + this commit)
- #3 — RFC 5927 §6 hard-vs-soft refactor ✅ (FSM-dispatch refactor
  Phases 1-4: `cdcb1808 → b6948c68`)
- #4 — IP options echo on Echo Reply, with LSRR/SSRR reversal ✅
  (`00a0ee7b` first-class option types; this commit wires the
  echo helper)

## Open SHOULDs (in suggested order)

### #3 — RFC 5927 §6 hard-vs-soft refactor (RECOMMENDED FIRST — folds into FSM-dispatch refactor)

**Spec:** RFC 5927 §6 distinguishes "hard" errors (must abort
SYN_SENT, advisory in synchronized states) from "soft" errors
(transient, never abort connection).

**Current:** `TcpSession.on_unreachable` treats all Destination-
Unreachable codes uniformly via the seq-in-window guard. Codes 0
(Net), 1 (Host), 5 (Bad Source Route) are "soft per RFC 5927 §6"
but currently flagged with `ConnError.HOST_UNREACHABLE` /
`NET_UNREACHABLE`, releasing the blocked syscall. This is a
partial — the connection isn't truly aborted, just notified.

**The fix:** per-state `handle_icmp` semantics. Each FSM state
decides what's hard for it:
- SYN_SENT: Port Unreachable → ConnError.REFUSED + CLOSED. Other
  codes → diagnostic only (don't release blocked CONNECT).
- Synchronized states: all ICMP errors are advisory (RFC 1122
  §4.2.3.9) — log + return.

**Cost:** medium — couples with the FSM-dispatch refactor (see
`docs/refactor/icmp_into_tcp_fsm_plan.md`). The refactor's Phase 2
naturally produces this hard/soft taxonomy.

**Recommendation:** ship as part of the FSM-dispatch refactor,
not separately.

### #2 — Parameter Problem outbound generation

**Spec:** RFC 1122 §3.2.2.5 SHOULD-generate; RFC 4443 §3.4 same.

**Trigger:** inbound IP datagram with malformed header or
unsupported option that the parser detects with a precise byte
offset.

**Current:** IPv4 / IPv6 parsers raise `Ip4SanityError` /
`Ip6SanityError` with a string message → packet drops. No ICMP
emission.

**The fix:**
1. Extend `Ip4SanityError` / `Ip6SanityError` to carry an
   optional `pointer: int | None` field (offset of offending
   field).
2. Each sanity check sets the pointer when raising.
3. Packet handler catches the sanity error in addition to dropping
   and emits Parameter Problem with the pointer.

**Files affected:**
- `net_proto/protocols/ip4/ip4__parser.py` — extend `_validate_sanity` to set pointer
- `net_proto/protocols/ip4/ip4__errors.py` — extend `Ip4SanityError`
- `net_proto/protocols/ip6/ip6__parser.py` — same
- `net_proto/protocols/ip6/ip6__errors.py` — same
- `pytcp/stack/packet_handler/packet_handler__ip4__rx.py` — catch+emit
- `pytcp/stack/packet_handler/packet_handler__ip6__rx.py` — same
- `pytcp/lib/packet_stats.py` — new emit/suppression counters per protocol

**Cost:** medium-high — most of the work is identifying *which*
sanity branches fire from *which* offsets. Currently the parsers
just say "field X is bad"; they need to surface offsets.

**Value:** medium-high — diagnostic clarity for misconfigured
peers; closes another SHOULD.

**Recommendation:** ship after the FSM-dispatch refactor and #3.
The new emit sites will go through `try_emit_icmp_error` —
already in place.

### #4 — IP options echo on Echo Reply (v4 only)

**Spec:** RFC 1122 §3.2.2.6 — "An ICMP Echo Reply SHOULD echo all
options received in the Echo Request."

**Current:** Echo Reply construction at
`packet_handler__icmp4__rx.py:317-323` copies only the data
field; IPv4 options are not threaded.

**The fix:** thread `packet_rx.ip4.options` through to
`_phtx_icmp4` and into the IP4 TX path's Echo Reply construction.

**Cost:** low — ~30 LOC change + 1 integration test.

**Value:** low — IPv4 options are rare in modern traffic.

**Recommendation:** polish commit; can ship anytime.

### #5 — Inbound Redirect handling (v4)

**Spec:** RFC 1122 §3.2.2.2 — host MUST accept and apply Redirect
to update routing.

**Current:** ICMPv4 type 5 (Redirect) is not declared in
`Icmp4Type`; routes to Unknown and is silently dropped.

**The fix (high cost):**
- New `Icmp4MessageRedirect` dataclass (RFC 792 wire format with
  `gateway_address` field)
- Parser dispatch + tests
- Routing-table mutability infrastructure (`stack` doesn't
  currently track per-destination gateway routes — single
  gateway per host)
- Validation per RFC 1122 §3.2.2.2 (gateway on same subnet,
  source is current first-hop)

**Cost:** high — requires routing-table refactor that PyTCP
doesn't have today.

**Value:** low — modern networks commonly disable Redirects for
security (Linux `accept_redirects=0` is default for hosts).
PyTCP's single-gateway model means architectural value is
marginal.

**Recommendation:** defer indefinitely unless multi-gateway
routing lands first. Document in audit as deliberate.

## Out-of-scope SHOULDs / future work (not blocking)

### MSG_ERRQUEUE / IP_RECVERR

Today, `UdpSocket.notify_unreachable` /
`UdpSocket.notify_time_exceeded` /
`UdpSocket.notify_parameter_problem` are thin shims (counter +
log). Application-level delivery (POSIX `recv(MSG_ERRQUEUE)` +
`SO_ERROR`) would require:
- New `socket.errqueue: deque[ErrorEvent]` per UdpSocket
- Wire `IP_RECVERR` / `IPV6_RECVERR` setsockopt
- Extend `recv()` to support the `MSG_ERRQUEUE` flag

Future feature — not a SHOULD violation today.

### RFC 4884 extended ICMP

We don't honor the `length` field in extended ICMP error
messages. Most peers don't emit extension structures; this is a
low-priority interop polish, not a SHOULD.

### TCP retransmission walkback after MSS shrink (RFC 1191 §6.5)

Phase 6 of the original ICMP demux+PMTUD refactor stopped at the
`on_pmtu` MSS-recompute step. Active retransmit walkback for
already-sent in-flight segments that exceed the new MSS is left
for a follow-up. Not strictly an ICMP issue — it's TCP
retransmission machinery.

---

## Suggested order

1. **FSM-dispatch refactor** (per
   `docs/refactor/icmp_into_tcp_fsm_plan.md`) — closes SHOULD #3
   naturally as part of Phase 2.
2. **#2 Parameter Problem outbound generation** — uses the new
   FSM dispatch from step 1; clean addition.
3. **#4 IP options echo** — small polish.
4. **#5 Redirect** — defer unless routing model changes.
